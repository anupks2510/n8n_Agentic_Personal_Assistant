## ✨ Features

- **Agentic AI workflows** in n8n for proactive task handling (e.g., email/calendar integration, research, automation chains)
- **Streamlit frontend** for easy user interaction — input queries, view results, trigger workflows
- Webhook / API integration between Streamlit and n8n (trigger n8n executions from UI)
- Modular and extensible — add more agents/tools in n8n
- Local run support for development and testing
